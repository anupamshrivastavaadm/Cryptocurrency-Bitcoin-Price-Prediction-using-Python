###Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin Price Prediction using Python

I'll begin the work of predicting the price of cryptocurrencies by loading the required Python modules and the dataset. I'll use the yfinance API to obtain the most recent information on Bitcoin values from Yahoo Finance for this work.

Every time you run this code, it will assist you gather the most recent data.

For any data science work, I have compiled the most recent information on Bitcoin values for the previous 365 days in the code above. Let's now examine the dataset's form to determine whether or not we are dealing with 365 rows.

Now Visualize the data

The dataset thus has 365 rows, with the names of each column appearing on the first row. 

Let's use a candlestick chart to illustrate the evolution of bitcoin values up to this point.

The numbers we need to forecast are in the Near column of the dataset.

So let's examine the correlation between each column in the information pertaining to the Close column.

Hence, using Python programming, you can utilise machine learning to forecast the price of any cryptocurrency.

Summary
Any cryptocurrency's price changes as a result of purchasing and selling, but buying and selling trends are influenced by a variety of factors. Only in circumstances where prices vary as a result of historical prices that consumers observe before buying and selling their coin can machine learning be used to anticipate prices. I hope you enjoyed reading this post about using Python to anticipate bitcoin prices using machine learning. Please feel free to leave your insightful remarks in the box below.

Thanks and happy coding!
